# TwitterMetrics
A small script for measuring word of mouth marketing via tweets on certain topics.

# Pre-requisites
You will need a Twitter developer app with the Essential (free) package.
Then you will need to generate yourself a BEARER_TOKEN.

# How to run
```
export BEARER_TOKEN=<your_bearer_token>
npm i && npm start // this will perform a recent search of tweets that contain the `#1Password` hashtag and save them in a csv file.
```
